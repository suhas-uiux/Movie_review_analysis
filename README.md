Here’s a complete `README.md` file for your **Movie Review Analysis** project, assuming it's a typical sentiment analysis project using machine learning with Python and possibly Streamlit for UI. You can copy and paste this directly into your repository:

```markdown
# 🎬 Movie Review Analysis 🎭

A machine learning project that performs **sentiment analysis** on movie reviews to classify them as **positive** or **negative**. This project demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) can be used to understand user opinions through text classification.

## 🧠 Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest (optional)
- TF-IDF or CountVectorizer for feature extraction

---

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suhas-uiux/Movie_review_analysis.git
   cd Movie_review_analysis
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application (optional Streamlit UI)**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```

---

## 📊 Sample Dataset

The dataset is assumed to have at least two columns:

| Review                             | Sentiment |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| "This movie was absolutely great!" | Positive  |
| "Waste of time, very boring."      | Negative  |

---

## 🧪 How to Run Experiments

You can use the Jupyter notebooks inside `/notebooks` to run training and testing pipelines:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
```

Or run via command line (if implemented in `src/`):

```bash
python src/train_model.py
python src/evaluate.py
```

---

## ✅ Output Example

```
Accuracy: 88.4%
Precision: 0.90
Recall: 0.87
F1 Score: 0.88
```

Confusion matrix and ROC curve will be printed during evaluation.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

Install all required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Common libraries used:

* scikit-learn
* pandas
* numpy
* nltk
* matplotlib / seaborn
* streamlit (for UI)

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add LSTM/GRU deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras
* Use word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe
* Deploy via Hugging Face or Docker
